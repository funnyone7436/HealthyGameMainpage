Hi! I’m a female engineer mom living in California with my two boys. I care deeply about creating technology that supports kids’ growth instead of draining it. With Healthy Games for Kids, I wanted to design something that encourages movement, balance, and safe fun — with no ads, no coins, and no harmful themes.

As an engineer, I’ve made the project fully open-source so other families, parents, or developers can explore the code, learn from it, and even create their own healthy games.
